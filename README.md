#  TopoCAM: ROI-Driven Topological Signatures in Medical Imaging

TopoCAM is a modular framework that combines explainable deep learning with topological data analysis (TDA) for interpretable and robust medical image classification. It supports both **3D volumetric scans** and **2D grayscale images**, and has been validated across multiple MedMNIST and BraTS benchmarks.

---

##  Motivation

Deep learning models often struggle with interpretability and robustness in clinical settings, especially under limited supervision. TopoCAM addresses this by:

- Localizing class-discriminative regions using **multi-scale Grad-CAM**
- Segmenting the input image/volume based on fused attention maps
- Computing **Betti curves** via cubical persistent homology
- Classifying topological descriptors using a lightweight MLP

This approach filters out irrelevant anatomy and concentrates analysis on clinically meaningful structures.

---

##  Pipeline Overview

We define the pipeline as $\hat{y} = g_\psi \circ \phi \circ A_{w,\tau} \circ f_\theta(\mathbf{X})$.


Where:
- `f_θ`: Pretrained CNN backbone (ResNet-18 for 2D, R3D-18 for 3D)
- `A_{w,τ}`: Weighted Grad-CAM fusion and thresholding
- `φ`: Betti curve computation from segmented input
- `g_ψ`: MLP classifier trained on topological features

## Datasets

Experiments are conducted on:

- **3D**: NoduleMNIST3D, FractureMNIST3D, SynapseMNIST3D, BraTS 2019/2021, Harvard OCT
- **2D**: BreastMNIST, PneumoniaMNIST

All inputs are resized to standardized shapes (e.g., 64×64×64 for 3D, 224×224 for 2D), and grayscale images are replicated to 3 channels for compatibility with pretrained CNNs.

##  Performance Highlights: TopoCAM vs CNN/ViT Baselines

TopoCAM consistently delivers superior diagnostic performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, especially in 3D volumes where traditional models often struggle with irrelevant anatomy and limited supervision.

##  Interpretability via Topology

TopoCAM improves interpretability by focusing on class-relevant regions and summarizing their geometric complexity. The following figures illustrate this:

##  Implementation Notes

- CNN backbones: `resnet18` (2D), `r3d_18` (3D), pretrained on ImageNet/Kinetics-400
- Grad-CAM fusion weights are optimized via **differential evolution** to maximize AUC
- Topological features are computed using **Giotto-TDA**
- MLP classifiers are shallow and efficient, trained with cross-entropy loss
